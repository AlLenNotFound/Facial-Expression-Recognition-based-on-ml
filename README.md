# Facial-Expression-Recognition-based-on-ml
the correctness of this projet is really touching,even better than a dice.

i try some basic ml algorithm like svm, decision tree, knn,logical regression type shit.Using gridsearch to find the maybe best Hyperparameter.

About the data-preprocess, first make it into grayscalar pic and then recognize the face and cut it out.

about features abstructed, i try hog and lbp, maybe lbp is proper one.

For the dataset, i use jiffe.
